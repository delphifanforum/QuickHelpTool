Tool combined 35 different commands into one program for IT professionals

Hello,

I have combined 35 different commands into a single .pas file to simplify the daily tasks of IT professionals. With this, you can quickly 
perform the operation you want by simply entering its number. Performing basic tasks such as Windows management, 
system maintenance, and network configuration is now much easier. Whether you want to view hardware information, 
adjust network settings, or even perform system maintenance tasks like firewall management and RAM optimization, you can do it all with just a few clicks.

This BAT file will become an indispensable tool for IT professionals, speeding up and simplifying management on Windows operating systems. 
Moreover, to execute any command, all you need to do is enter the corresponding number.
